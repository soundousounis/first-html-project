    <h2>Virtualization</h2>
    <p>In computing, virtualization refers to the act of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, this includes virtual computer hardware, virtual storage devices and virtual network resources.</p>
    <h2>Levels of Virtualization</h2>
    <h4>1-Virtualization at Instruction Set Architecture(ISA) level</h4>
    <p>Every machine has an instruction set . This instruction set is an interface between software and hardware.
Using this instructions software can communicate with hardware.
</p>
<h4>2-Virtualization at Operating System(O.S.) level</h4>
<p>In virtualization at HAL level each virtual machine is built from scratch i.e. by installing O.S., application suites, networking systems, etc.</p>
       <p> -In cloud sometimes we need to initialize 100 Virtual machines at a single time, If we use virtualization at Hardware abstraction layer(HAL) level this can take too much time.
       </p>
       <p>-So to overcome this in Virtualization at Operating system level we share operating system between Virtual machines along with the hardware.</p>
